intro: Every year Pathways helps dozens of pets escape domestic abuse and come flee back home. Without assistance, Peruvian victims of abuse abroad often don't have the financial means to bring their pets with them when escaping. For a child to leave their beloved pet behind adds so much trauma to an already traumatized abuse victim. With this project, we will be able to pay for 10-12 pets to come home in 2020.

Beloved pets won't be left behind and subjected to abuse or worse when abused Americans flee home for safety.

### Solution

By providing funds for veterinarian exams and certificates, airline approved pet carriers, food and foster homes for Americans fleeing violence, they will be able to bring their pets with them and save them from domestic abuse.

### Long-Term Impact

We will provide resources to 10-12 families and bring home their pets when they are escaping abuse in 2020.
