In the last 100 years, the worldwide cheetah population has decreased by almost 90%, from about 100,000 to an estimated 7,100 animals in the wild. Most of these cheetahs live outside protected areas on commercially used farmland. Farmers see the cheetahs as a threat to their livestock. They set traps and kill the elegant cats.

Together with its partner organisation LOM in Namibia, the SOS-Cheetah is committed to the protection of cheetahs. Cheetah-friendly livestock husbandry methods are being developed to increase the acceptance of cheetahs as part of a natural ecosystem in order to permanently resolve the ongoing conflict between humans and wildlife. An important project is the Herd Protection Dog Programme. The dogs protect their herd and thus increase the willingness of the farmers, cheetahs, to accept on their farmland and not to kill!

Also in Kenya and Somaliland the SOS-Cheetah is committed to the protection of cheetahs. The stocks in the Horn of Africa are under particular pressure, as a large proportion of the cheetah young animals illegally sold as pets at street markets or on the Internet originate here.
