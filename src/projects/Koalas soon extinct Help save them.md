The habitat of the Koalas is more and more decimated. Thus the charismatic marsupials stand again and again before obstacles like streets and houses or they are tracked down and attacked by stray dogs.

Scientific studies in the region known as the Koala Coast in southeast Brisbane show a frightening decline in the Koala population there. Within only three years, the continuance of the rare marsupials halved. This means a loss of about 2,300 animals! In no time the entire population could be extinct. It is also to be feared that koala stocks in other regions will show similarly high loss rates.

Although some protected areas have already been designated, most of the koala habitat is still outside protected areas and on the urban margins. Again and again it comes thereby to deadly collisions of the marsupials with cars and attacking dogs.
