Our main activity is the raising of orphaned young animals, the rehabilitation of adult squirrels and their subsequent reintroduction into the wild as well as the education about the way of life of our squirrels. As a contact and advice centre, we also answer questions from helpless finders almost around the clock.

The young animals are raised by us with a lot of love and commitment and the injured are cared for under veterinary care. Always with the aim of releasing the animals into freedom afterwards. Afterwards, they can get used to their natural surroundings and life in freedom again in large garden aviaries. This is the only way to ensure successful reintroduction. And the effort is worth it! Seeing the animals joyfully exploring the surroundings outweighs all the cost and effort.

Our large aviary system is very close to nature, so that the croissants grow up as naturally as possible. Bark mulch and smaller tree trunks are distributed on the ground. We also place branches and tree parts so that the raised animals can jump, climb and romp.
